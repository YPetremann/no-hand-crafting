Version 2.0.0
Date 31.5.2015
  Changes:
    - burner assembler can craft all recipe the player could craft by hand
    - burner assembler scale by itself
    - no longer use whitelist/blacklist system
  Explanations :
    While making this version, I made a auto-discovery system to analyse the
    game and I came in conclusion that it would be a bit dificult to create a
    generic system to select recipes that block the game progression, the system
    could still be used to analyse the game to show what can or can't be made in
    a complete playthrough, so I decided to make it to do so.

    Also the main reason I made this mod is not to create no crafting challenge
    2.0 but to consider the fact we are playing not as a craftsman but as an
    industrial engineer. One thing it permit is to force us to completely design
    factories for such type of items instead of crafting them by hand. So I take
    the decision that the burner assembler would have the possibility to craft
    everything the player could craft before.
